I am a computer scientist and applied mathematician, and a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Minnesota, Department of Computer Science. My research is focused on the application of ideas from topology and category theory within AI and Neuroscience. I am interested in the general class of problems related to characterizing computations that exist on or are parameterized by networks. Particularly interesting are artificial neural networks and how their connectivity structure, at both the parameter and architecture level, affect the representations embedded within this network structure. My hope is that by applying mathematical tools with the proper level of abstraction, we can better probe these representations embedded in these complex network structures, allowing for more explainable AI and further insight into the principles of cognition.
