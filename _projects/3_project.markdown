DFT calculations are used as training data to pre-dict equilibrium binding constants of small molecules to cu curbit[7]uril (CB[7]) with kernel-based support vector machinelearning. This trained algorithm was then used to predict thebinding of two promising small molecule drugs in the clinicagainst pediatric low grade glioma, TAK-580 and Selumetinib.The algorithm predicted strong binding for TAK-580 and poorbinding for Selumetinib. These results were experimentally vali-dated. It was also discovered that the slightly larger homologuecucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) is partial to Selumetinib, suggesting anopportunity for tunable release kinetics by introducing differ-ent concentrations of CB[7] or CB[8] into a system such as ahydrogel depot for local drug delivery.  We also qualitativelydemonstrated that these two drugs have different therapeuticwindows and may have utility in combination against low gradegliomas. Finally, mass transfer simulations were performed toshow how CB[7] can independently tune the release of TAK-580across time scales from seconds to a year without changing thekinetics of Selumetinib. This work shows how machine learningmay prove valuable in the development of drug-delivery sys-tems for combination therapies and the field of supramolecularchemistry more broadly.
